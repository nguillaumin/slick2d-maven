* Fixed `AppContainer.setMouseCursor()` by using correct image dimensions thanks to [Peter W](https://bitbucket.org/kevglass/slick/issue/40/using-wrong-variable)
* Fixed `SpriteSheetFont.drawString()` with indexes thanks to [Emmanuel Rousseau](https://bitbucket.org/kevglass/slick/issue/39/rendering-bug-with-spritesheetfont)

* Fixed `Image.getColor()` for [scaled images](https://bitbucket.org/kevglass/slick/issue/42/getcolor-crashes-for-a-flipped-image)

* Merge changes from [development branch](https://bitbucket.org/kevglass/slick/commits/96a4b840204c65241d5bf81afbb4eead5f25c57f) since [Feb 04, 2012](https://bitbucket.org/kevglass/slick/commits/d0a74b4374b88b6abae9f9643c36c0819994c870)
  * Fixes Circle.contains(x,y) for the dev branch.
  * Override Shape#getCenter in Circle.
    This fixes bug #13.
  * Add matching get for Shape#setLocation(Vector2f)  
    This adds Vector2f Shape#getLocation().
  * Fix Circle#contains(x,y).  
    Previous implementation used top left corner as center of circle for contains().
  * Streamline and clean up DistanceFieldEffect and document it better
  * Add a signed distance field effect  
    This can be used for crisp font rendering even at high magnifications,
    at little to no extra runtime cost. For details, see the Valve paper:
    http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf
  * Merge with b7d3f117e9cdbb0bf1180906662f11f3362be5d6
  * small change to UnicodeFont to use codepoints 32-127 for addAsciiGlyphs; otherwise some Mac users report load times greater than 3 seconds
  * fixing strange Java2D bug with UnicodeFont; should reduce loading times on Mac. Note: addAsciiGlyphs now only adds glyphs 0-127
  * Merged in dayrinni/slick-day-animation-cycle/development (pull request #8)
  * Small changes to the animation class that allow for pausing before cycling. ie: Cycle through all of the animation and wait 1000 MS before beginning again. Also made some changes to a constructor to fix an issue with animation and sprite sheets.
  * fixing rotate bug with drawEmbedded
  * fixing slick-util build file
  * building newest slick; upgrading to latest LWJGL; fixing bug with TGA cursor loading
  * overloading image constructor
  * fixing headless mode
  * fixing typo in ShaderProgram
  * Improved cursor loader.  
    The new cursor loader is now able to fix cursor images so the host system is able to work with them properly. It performs changes of the texture size and is able to fix alpha values. It works with cursors that are too small for the host system and with cursor too large. How ever the support for larger cursors is limited to avoid crashes. The cursor will likely look crappy.
  * Removed some bogus modifier in a interface (public, abstract)
  * Fixed loading of PNG data using the TWL PNG loader
  * allowing symbols in text fields, using CharSequence instead of String for fonts
  * fixing advanced shader test
  * adding shader lessons
  *

  * pedigree now catches all exceptions
  * trying to patch transparent color bug; fixed incorrect mouse Y (it's now 1 pixel lower)
  * "base=" is now the baseline/ascent for AngelCodeFont for better compatibility with TWL Font Tool
  * adding resize feature to AppGameContainer

  * small BUG/RFE run: shape points check, image/texture documentation, fire emitter temp fix, ScalableGame scale x/y getters
  * Implements accelerometer input.
  * fixed bug where OpenGL wasn't destroyed from canvas container exit; fixing canvas tests to hide the frame before destroying OpenGL

    Added parsing for opacity values of layers (need to still make render method render opaque layers)

  * this commit changes the StateBasedGame such that the enter method of a state is called before the render method (by calling it before the entering transition starts)
  * added author
  * fixing image filter constants
  * bugs fixed:  
      Image - various fixes - http://slick.javaunlimited.net/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=4454  
        - (width, height, filter) constructor reduced by using EmptyImageData
        - draw/drawSheared/drawEmbedded now all check for init() before rendering
        - startUse/endUse now rely on Texture instead of Image (i.e. as long as its the same texture, it's ok)
        - Image.setTexture will revert the "destroyed" flag if changed  
    Image/FBO/Pbuffer - fixed offscreen memory leak  
    InternalTextureLoader - added getTextureCount() method - returns the number of active textures  
    TextureImpl - release() now reverts the textureID to zero (subsequent calls to release() is then ignored)  
    Image - center of rotation - http://slick.javaunlimited.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4252  
    SoundStore - last source never played - http://slick.javaunlimited.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3659
